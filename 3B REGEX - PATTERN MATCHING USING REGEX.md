## REGEX - PATTERN MATCHING USING REGEX

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program that matches a string containing an `'a'` followed by **two to three `'b'` characters** using regular expressions.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Accept a string `str1` from the user.  
3. Define the regular expression pattern as `r"[a]+b{2,3}"`.  
4. Use the `re.match()` function to check if the string `str1` matches the pattern.  
5. If a match is found, print `"Found a match!"`.  
6. If no match is found, print `"Not matched!"`.  
7. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```
# Reg.No: 212223060107
# Name: Joyce Priscilla R

import re
str=input()
x=re.search("bb",str)
if x:
    print("Found a match!")
else:
    print("Not matched!")
```
